# Spotify_API

You must enter your own CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET which can be sourced from developer.spotify.com 

This Program offers base code to build off of for Python projects based on the Spotify Web API. 
The Spotify class contains necessary functions for user authentication through the APIs tokens 
as well as a search function that can accept queries for songs, albums, and artists


This was made as practice for implementing APIs through token authentication as well as generating queries.
